How would you return a rejected promise in an async function and catch the rejection in the calling code?
16. Using Promise.all with Mixed Resolved and Rejected Promises
Given a set of promises where some may resolve and others may reject, use async/await and Promise.all() to ensure that you get the result of all promises without them interrupting each other.
17. Gracefully Handling Multiple Rejections
If you have multiple promises that can individually reject, write a function using async/await that handles each rejection without affecting others.

How do you handle nested promises inside an async function and ensure that each promise resolves before the next one starts?
20. Avoiding Promise Rejection in async/await
Write a function where you call multiple async functions, but if one of them rejects, the error is not thrown, and the program continues.
21. Handling Async Code with Loops
How would you iterate through an array of promises using async/await, ensuring that each promise resolves before the next iteration starts?
22. Handling Promise Rejection with a Default Value
If you have a promise p1 that can either resolve or reject, how would you handle the rejection and return a default value instead using async/await?
23. Async/Await with setInterval
How can you use async/await with setInterval to repeatedly run a function until a certain condition is met?
24. Timeout for Async Functions
How would you implement a timeout for an async function using async/await so that the function either resolves or rejects after a fixed time limit?
25. Awaiting Multiple Promise Rejections
If you need to handle a situation where multiple promises might reject, use async/await to ensure that the rejection from one promise doesn’t stop the other promises from being handled.
26. Conditional async/await Execution
How would you conditionally resolve or reject a promise in an async function, depending on the value passed into the function?
27. Async/Await with API Calls
How would you use async/await to fetch data from an API and handle the error if the API request fails?
28. Async/Await with External Libraries
How would you use async/await in combination with an external library that provides promises? For example, using axios for making HTTP requests.
29. Handling Large Data Fetch with async/await
Given a promise that fetches a large chunk of data, how would you handle it with async/await to prevent blocking the main thread?
30. Handling Multiple Dependencies in Async Code
Given two promises p1 and p2 where p2 depends on the result of p1, write an async/await solution to ensure p2 resolves after p1.
31. Cancellation of Async Function
How would you implement a cancellation mechanism in an async function using async/await and AbortController?
32. Retrying Failed Async Calls
How would you implement a retry mechanism for an async function that retries a promise when it fails using async/await?

How would you use async/await in combination with Promise.any() to return the first resolved promise from multiple promises?
34. Chaining Multiple Async Calls
How do you chain multiple async calls in an async function, ensuring that each resolves before the next call is made?

Use async/await with Promise.allSettled() to log the outcome of multiple promises that may resolve or reject.
